            <h1>Identifying alternative sustainable electricity sources for a school institution</h1>
            <h3>Why Schools Need Sustainable Electricity Sources
                Imagine a school that never has power outages, reduces its carbon footprint, and saves money—all while teaching students about sustainability. Here’s why schools should make the switch to alternative electricity sources:</h3>

                <p>Save Money, Spend Smart:
                Energy bills can drain school budgets. By using solar or wind power, schools can cut costs and use the savings for better programs and resources.</p>
                
                <p>Help the Planet:
                Every solar panel or wind turbine reduces greenhouse gas emissions, showing students that schools can lead the way in fighting climate change.</p>
                
                <p>Reliability is Key:
                Renewable energy sources like solar and wind can keep the school powered, rain or shine, without the worry of sudden outages.</p>
                
                <p>Hands-on Learning:
                Switching to green energy creates real-world lessons in science and technology that students can engage with daily.</p>
                
                <p>Future-Proof:
                The world is shifting toward green energy. Schools that adopt sustainable power now are ahead of the curve and preparing for a cleaner, brighter future.</p>
