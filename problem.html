                <p>  High Energy Costs:
                Traditional energy sources are expensive, draining school budgets and leaving less money for educational resources.</p>
                
                <p>Environmental Damage:
                Relying on fossil fuels increases pollution and contributes to climate change, harming the planet.</p>
                
                <p>Unreliable Power:
                Traditional energy grids are prone to outages, disrupting classes and learning activities.</p>
                
                <p>Missed Learning Opportunities:
                Without sustainable energy, schools miss teaching students about renewable energy and sustainability.</p>
                
                <p>Health Risks:
                Fossil fuel use can lead to air pollution, affecting the health of students and staff.</p>
                
                <p>Long-Term Viability:
                Schools that donâ€™t adopt renewable energy risk falling behind as the world moves toward sustainability.</p>
